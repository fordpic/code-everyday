DAY 0: April 6, 2021

Today's Progress: Decided to join the #100DaysOfCode challenge today with the rest of my cohort! I also decided on a new stack to implement for my upcoming Hack Week project.

Thoughts: I'll be buiding a web scraper with my classmate for the Hack Week project - it should be fun and a great learning experience, but I would be lying if I said this would be a walk in the park; however, I'm really looking forward to this one and challenging myself, I'll be ready. Cheers!

DAY 1: April 7, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed a "countTheBits" code challenge =

- Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer.
- The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.

Today I also did some Python work and AWS Amplify practice, in preparation of building a web scraper / crawler in the coming days.

Thoughts: The code challenge itself wasn't all that bad, but I am looking forward to the challenge of building a web scraper with an entirely new stack here soon, as that will be challenging to do in a week's time.

DAY 2: April 8, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed 3 entry level Python challenges: finding the shortest word in a string, finding the sum of minimums in three lists, and splitting strings and grouping them in a list and a certain index. I continued to dive into AWS Amplify and the BeatifulSoup framework for the Hack Week project as well.

Thoughts: I had a good time doing the Python challenges today and continuing to learn the flexible language; day 2 couldn't have gone better, considering I started learning Python on the first day of the challenge! Hope to continue to improve over the coming days & weeks. The BeautifulSoup framework was giving me a good bit of trouble getting it imported, but now it's feeling very powerful and I'm glad I chose to learn it for this week's mini project.
