DAY 0: April 6, 2021

Today's Progress: Decided to join the #100DaysOfCode challenge today with the rest of my cohort! I also decided on a new stack to implement for my upcoming Hack Week project.

Thoughts: I'll be buiding a web scraper with my classmate for the Hack Week project - it should be fun and a great learning experience, but I would be lying if I said this would be a walk in the park; however, I'm really looking forward to this one and challenging myself, I'll be ready. Cheers!

DAY 1: April 7, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed a "countTheBits" code challenge =

- Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer.
- The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.

Today I also did some Python work and AWS Amplify practice, in preparation of building a web scraper / crawler in the coming days.

Thoughts: The code challenge itself wasn't all that bad, but I am looking forward to the challenge of building a web scraper with an entirely new stack here soon, as that will be challenging to do in a week's time.

DAY 2: April 8, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed 3 entry level Python challenges: finding the shortest word in a string, finding the sum of minimums in three lists, and splitting strings and grouping them in a list and a certain index. I continued to dive into AWS Amplify and the BeautifulSoup framework for the Hack Week project as well.

Thoughts: I had a good time doing the Python challenges today and continuing to learn the flexible language; day 2 couldn't have gone better, considering I started learning Python on the first day of the challenge! Hope to continue to improve over the coming days & weeks. The BeautifulSoup framework was giving me a good bit of trouble getting it imported, but now it's feeling very powerful and I'm glad I chose to learn it for this week's mini project.

DAY 3: April 9, 2021

Today's Progress: Spent time learning the Django framework & continued to work towards deploying the Hack Week project. Built a web scraper for a static web page using BeautifulSoup.

Thoughts: I found Django to be frustrating but great once you could get the thing running how it's supposed to. Errors & rigid file structures were killers. In regards to the project, I finished building a web scraper for a static page using BS4 which I enjoyed immensely. I created others in the same format for different pages, and worked towards getting them deployed to AWS Amplify with my partner. Who knew getting Python dependencies pushed to the cloud was so complicated... 

Day 4: April 10, 2021

Today's Progress: Continued to work towards deploying the web scraper for my Hack Week project on AWS Amplify.

Thoughts: My entire time spent coding today was focused towards getting the correct response I wanted into AWS Amplify from the web scraper I built. I thought the serverless backend was going to be the hard part, howeber this lambda function in Amplify is so finicky - it is by far the hardest part. Will keep chipping away at it tomorrow!

Day 5: April 11, 2021

Today's Progress: Finally got the web scraper deployed via AWS Amplify & straightened out the project deliverables with my partner (presentation, readme, etc).

Thoughts: Happy day, my partner & I finally got the web scraper deployed to AWS Amplify. It's not exactly what we wanted, as we ended up needing to scale back the scraper just a bit to get the response we wanted from Amplify. We believe that many of our woes stem from the fact that Amplify is way more powerful than our local machines, and the lambda function is executing quicker than the get request is actually fetching the data - we've built in a timer for now, but definitely something he & I must address moving forward!

Day 6: April 12, 2021

Today's Progress: Presented my Hack Week project, completed another long Django exercise, continuing to work through Python modules.

Thoughts: The web scraper presentation went well today, I believe we'll continue to build upon this idea & make the scraper dynamic & able to scrape multiple sites. I'm not sure I enjoy Django more than say Express, but I can see & appreciate all the work it does under the hood, which is not insignificant. Moving forward I am continuing to learn Python and push through online materials & courses - I will master it soon!

Day 7: April 13, 2021

Today's Progress: Spent the entire day building Django REST APIs.

Thoughts: Though not necessarily exciting, today was definitely well spent learning the ends & outs of the Django Python framework & leveraging it to make a REST API; these are what make the framework the most interesting/powerful in my opinion, so I'm glad I'm spending some real time on it. I'd be lying if I said I preferred this to Express, but I think it will just take a little love from my end to smooth the experience out. 

Day 8: April 14, 2021

Today's Progress: Continued my deep dive into the Django framework & Django REST APIs.

Thoughts: I know Django is going to be really helpful in the long run, but boy oh boy is it a beast to set up and get functioning correctly. It's so sleek & powerful but so finicky at the same time - Django is doing so much under the hood that I'm always worried I'm missing something somewhere, since I'm so used to doing everything to set up Express. I will continue to give it my all to learn the ins & outs of the framework!

Day 9: April 15, 2021

Today's Progress: Learned how to use & implement user authentication in Django!

Thoughts: What a day! It was an absolute beast learning how to do user auth in Django but I think it the long run it is going to be so worth it. After spending hours on hours trying to get my bcrypt auth to work in Express, Django feels like a breath of fresh air in that regard. Deciding on what I'm going to do for my final capstone project tomorrow!

Day 10: April 16, 2021

Today's Progress: Began working with new frameworks for web scraping, including Selenium & Scrapy.

Thoughts: Today I began working through using Selenium (in conjunction with the previous BeautifulSoup scraper) & Scrapy (which is more of a BeautifulSoup substitute). I'm trying to get a full overview of web scraping and all of the technologies involved, so I can choose which one I'd like to use for my final capstone project (going with a big ole dynamic web scraping app) - I can't wait!

Day 11: April 17, 2021

Today's Progress: Worked through multiple code challenges on CodeWars in both JavaScript & Python.

Thoughts: I took a small break from web scraping & Django today to focus a bit on brushing up my JS & Python skills. To be perfectly transparent, I am not all that good at code challenges YET, but I am determined to become a master in a few languages at them, They're so helpful & help me to think int he right mindset of a programmer - I will be doing a lot more of these over the coming days & weeks!

Day 12: April 18, 2021

Today's Progress: Continued honing Python skills with a few code challenges & an online teaching series.

Thoughts: Today I figured that I would really dive into Python as a language to get better not only at it but to set myself up for success with this web scraping capstone project. I spent a good bit of time today on CodeWars again (love that site) but unfortunately couldn't do any challenges harder than 7kyu yet - I'll keep working at it! I also started the Python Mastery course from Treehouse, which I'm hoping can help smooth the edges a bit as well. Really loving Python though as my second programming language!

Day 13: April 19, 2021

Today's Progress: Continued to spend more time diving into the online Python mastery course & Amplify work.

Thoughts: Today was a tough one, as we continued to have issues with our lambda function and user authentication on AWS Amplify. It just doesn't seem to want to work - had to put it down for the day to focus on something else & revisit later. On the bright side, I've been tearing through the previously mentioned Python mastery course online through Treehouse, and I'm really starting to nail the language down. Will continue to work at the Amplify issues so that the capstone project is perfect!

Day 14: April 20, 2021

Today's Progress: Finished up the dynamic web scraper for a new site to go along with the static one; continued AWS studies.

Thoughts: Today was all about the web scrapers for my capstone project. Though the pages were annoying to drill down into for the correct content, the dopamine rush of seeing allll the information returned in the terminal in the format that you intended is addicting. I believe that I will continue to play around and push my limits in web scraping even once this project is over, because the pure concept of it is so fascinating to me.

Day 15: April 21, 2021

Today's Progress: Hooked React frontend up to dynamic web scraping backend being hosted on AWS Amplify.

Thoughts: It felt good to step back into React and get the frontend hooked up after so many days spent dying over the AWS Lambda function. Overall the project is feeling really good, these next few days will be spent fine tuning the UI/UX experience; oh happy days..
