DAY 0: April 6, 2021

Today's Progress: Decided to join the #100DaysOfCode challenge today with the rest of my cohort! I also decided on a new stack to implement for my upcoming Hack Week project.

Thoughts: I'll be buiding a web scraper with my classmate for the Hack Week project - it should be fun and a great learning experience, but I would be lying if I said this would be a walk in the park; however, I'm really looking forward to this one and challenging myself, I'll be ready. Cheers!

DAY 1: April 7, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed a "countTheBits" code challenge =

- Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer.
- The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.

Today I also did some Python work and AWS Amplify practice, in preparation of building a web scraper / crawler in the coming days.

Thoughts: The code challenge itself wasn't all that bad, but I am looking forward to the challenge of building a web scraper with an entirely new stack here soon, as that will be challenging to do in a week's time.

DAY 2: April 8, 2021

Today's Progress: Completed 3 entry level Python challenges: finding the shortest word in a string, finding the sum of minimums in three lists, and splitting strings and grouping them in a list and a certain index. I continued to dive into AWS Amplify and the BeautifulSoup framework for the Hack Week project as well.

Thoughts: I had a good time doing the Python challenges today and continuing to learn the flexible language; day 2 couldn't have gone better, considering I started learning Python on the first day of the challenge! Hope to continue to improve over the coming days & weeks. The BeautifulSoup framework was giving me a good bit of trouble getting it imported, but now it's feeling very powerful and I'm glad I chose to learn it for this week's mini project.

DAY 3: April 9, 2021

Today's Progress: Spent time learning the Django framework & continued to work towards deploying the Hack Week project. Built a web scraper for a static web page using BeautifulSoup.

Thoughts: I found Django to be frustrating but great once you could get the thing running how it's supposed to. Errors & rigid file structures were killers. In regards to the project, I finished building a web scraper for a static page using BS4 which I enjoyed immensely. I created others in the same format for different pages, and worked towards getting them deployed to AWS Amplify with my partner. Who knew getting Python dependencies pushed to the cloud was so complicated... 

Day 4: April 10, 2021

Today's Progress: Continued to work towards deploying the web scraper for my Hack Week project on AWS Amplify.

Thoughts: My entire time spent coding today was focused towards getting the correct response I wanted into AWS Amplify from the web scraper I built. I thought the serverless backend was going to be the hard part, howeber this lambda function in Amplify is so finicky - it is by far the hardest part. Will keep chipping away at it tomorrow!

Day 5: April 11, 2021

Today's Progress: Finally got the web scraper deployed via AWS Amplify & straightened out the project deliverables with my partner (presentation, readme, etc).

Thoughts: Happy day, my partner & I finally got the web scraper deployed to AWS Amplify. It's not exactly what we wanted, as we ended up needing to scale back the scraper just a bit to get the response we wanted from Amplify. We believe that many of our woes stem from the fact that Amplify is way more powerful than our local machines, and the lambda function is executing quicker than the get request is actually fetching the data - we've built in a timer for now, but definitely something he & I must address moving forward!

Day 6: April 12, 2021

Today's Progress: Presented my Hack Week project, completed another long Django exercise, continuing to work through Python modules.

Thoughts: The web scraper presentation went well today, I believe we'll continue to build upon this idea & make the scraper dynamic & able to scrape multiple sites. I'm not sure I enjoy Django more than say Express, but I can see & appreciate all the work it does under the hood, which is not insignificant. Moving forward I am continuing to learn Python and push through online materials & courses - I will master it soon!
